    "The clustering method k-means aims to partition N observations into K clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The problem is NP hard. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical background\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-means algorithm takes a dataset X of N points as input, together with a parameter K specifying how many clusters to create. The output is a set of K cluster centroids and a labeling of X that assigns each of the points in X to a unique cluster. All points within a cluster are closer in distance to their centroid than they are to any other centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical condition for the K clusters $C_k$ and the K centroids $\\mu_k$ can be expressed as: \n",
    "\n",
    "Minimize $\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^K \\sum_{\\mathrm{x}_n \\in C_k} ||\\mathrm{x}_n - \\mu_k ||^2$ with respect to $\\displaystyle C_k, \\mu_k$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lloyd's algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterative method known as the k-means algorithm or Lloyd’s algorithm exists that converges (albeit to a local minimum) in few steps. The procedure alternates between two operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once a set of centroids $\\mu_k$ is available, the clusters are updated to contain the points closest in distance to each centroid. \n",
    "2. Given a set of clusters, the centroids are recalculated as the means of all points belonging to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle C_k = \\{\\mathrm{x}_n : ||\\mathrm{x}_n - \\mu_k|| \\leq \\mathrm{\\,\\,all\\,\\,} ||\\mathrm{x}_n - \\mu_l||\\}\\qquad(1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\mu_k = \\frac{1}{C_k}\\sum_{\\mathrm{x}_n \\in C_k}\\mathrm{x}_n\\qquad(2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-step procedure continues until the assignments of clusters and centroids no longer change. As already mentioned, the convergence is guaranteed but the solution might be a local minimum. In practice, the algorithm is run multiple times and averaged. For the starting set of centroids, several methods can be employed, for instance random assignation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-means algorithm works reasonably well when the data fits the cluster model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The clusters are spherical: the data points in a cluster are centered around that cluster\n",
    "* The spread/variance of the clusters is similar: Each data point belongs to the closest cluster\n"
